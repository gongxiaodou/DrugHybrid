# monoDiKGap
## monoDiKGap Theoretical Description
When -kgap=n then the (20) × (20 × 20) × n features will exist for protein.  
When -kgap=1, feature structure will be X_XX.  
When -kgap=2, feature structure will be X_XX, and X_ _XX.  
When -kgap=3, feature structure will be X_XX, X_ _ XX, and X_ _ _ XX.
